# Flight Ticket Booking System

A full-stack web application for booking airline tickets. This project was developed by a team of four using **Python (Django)** and **SQLite**. The system allows users to search for flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and process payments â€” with features such as seat selection, invoice printing, and timeout-based booking sessions.
